1,"I’m so excited, this game is going to provide me so much entertainment for a long time"
2,Man the gaming industry really loved ignoring Africa huh.
3,I've already invited my friends to play! Can't wait to play the full game.
4,"Hey, if this industry is going to continue to ignore the continent that is the single largest contributor to all of your hardware resources, can you send us back all of the cobalt from your devices? Y'all really think Africa is decorative."
5,"It's going to take me a long time to play through all the Origin characters, plus the Dark Urge, plus the several original characters. Thank you for making this game."
6,Will we be able to pre-install the game from steam?
7,"Yo @baldursgate3, This is Africa. Double check you charts. 2nd largest continent, 2nd largest populated continent."
8,Will there be pre-load?
9,"What if you allowed EA holders to start playing a week before everyone else

 haha jk unless??"
10,Love how you used Gent as the reference for central european time.
11,Me waiting for the ps5 version to release…
12,"Quick question, do you expect the final version to run smoother on lower specs PCs, than the beta ? Currently my PC is struggling a bit but making it work, but places like Baldur's Gate itself make me worried it'll be too much for it"
13,"Will there be an option to pre-download the full-release, at least on Steam?"
14,Will having EA installed prior make the launch just an update or will we have to fully redownload?
15,Nice.  Hopefully the Steam servers hold up well.  LOL
16,Hope we will be able to pre-download the game.  (Please) - I guess 100-150GB will take a half a day maybe even a few days for some of us.
17,"Hey, just wanna check, but those of us who preordered during Early Access period have 72 hours advance start here, right? So that period starts July 31?"
18,"this game is about to go insane in sales the developer has been telling us he plays the game he loves the game hes allowing modding, this is what we expect from a game company we play the game we are will to take feedback and make it better i bet the sales will match d4"
19,Setting my alarm!
20,Will the update be downloaded prior to these times or is it at these times that it starts updating? ??
21,Preload when ????
22,Pre-load on GalaxyGoG some time before ? In order to be up to date when launch time comes ?
23,any chance for us to download the game before that date and time? Some people with slower download times hoping to get a head start on downloading a massive game like this
24,Global? Where is Africa you racist idiots?
25,Any chance you an bump up the PS5 release date? Maybe a little green can grease your palm.
26,Extremely disappointing that you forgot Africa to even list one African time zone. Shame on you.
27,Apologies if it has been already answered but is the full release version will be available to preload?
28,We’ll have to play together at some point hehe!

33,You missed an entire continent
34,"hey guys so, it kinda sucks when you look at world map and it literally ignores a whole continent that has millions of people and thousands of fans. Baldurs Gate was a core memory and experience for me growing up and seeing that you guys dont consider Africa sucks"
35,The fact you used Dublin on this map is an instant buy from me now ??????
36,Has the game been denied classification in Australia and New Zealand? I can't find any stores that are stocking it.
