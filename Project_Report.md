    Our group analyzed the effects of an online harassment campaign known as "Gamergate" on language use by fans throughout the gaming industry. Specifically, did Gamergate cause people in the gaming community to adopt more negative language? Gamergate, a movement that took place from 2013-2014, was a campaign focused on harassing women and minorities in the gaming community. In order to analyze the effects of Gamergate, we looked at social media posts for two games that were released before and after Gamergate. The games that were released before Gamergate were Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 and Dragon Age: Inquisition, and the games released after Gamergate were Baldurs Gate 3 and Grand Theft Auto 6. Black Ops 2 and GTA 6 are both games with very toxic communities, while Dragon Age and Baldurs Gate 3 have less controversial communities with more female and LGBTQ representation. We did this on purpose to analyze the effects of Gamergate on different spheres of the gaming community. Our hypothesis is that language sentiment in the gaming community has become more negative since Gamergate.
    Our data collection methods consisted of manually scraping tweets from the official announcement post for each game. While we initially wished to scrape large amounts of data, the python package we had planned on using was not supported on the version of python using in JupyterHub. For each post except for GTA 6, each comment was collected to ensure that there was no bias in data collection. For GTA 6, the first 200 tweets were chosen all at once to ensure that there was no bias in data collection. After collecting the tweets, the language sentiment of each tweet was analyzed using the VADER sentiment python package. VADER, which stands for Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner, is a tool used to analyze language sentiment in social media. VADER is what told us whether or not each tweet was positive or negative. In order to use VADER, we used an additional package called the Natural Language Resource Toolkit. This was necessary for classifying the text in the tweets and providing a lexicon for VADER to use.
    After all of the data was collected and processed through VADER, we were able to create plots and compare data between the games before and after Gamergate. The game with the highest ratio of negative comments was Black Ops 2, with 45/173 negative comments, which is 26%. The game with the least negative sentiment was Baldurs Gate 3, with 4/204 negative comments, which is about 2%. GTA 6 had 5/185 negative comments and Dragon Age: Inquisition had 9/98 negative comments, which are 2.7% and 9.1%, respectively. Comparing the games by their communities, the games with largely negative communities went from 26% to 2.7% after Gamergate, and the games with largely positive communities went from 9.1% to 2%. 
    Looking at the results, they directly contradict what we initially thought. Because Gamergate was such a negative movement, we assumed that more negative language sentiment would be adopted post Gamergate. However, the exact opposite appeared to be true. Each post Gamergate game showed significantly fewer negative comments than those released before it. This brings awareness to some of the flaws of our project, such as the need for manual data scraping and the small sample that we needed to work with because of that. However, even though this contradicts our hypothesis, it still poses an interesting conclusion. One such conclusion is that Gamergate prompted the larger gaming community to step up against harassment, and representation became more common and seen as more necessary in the gaming industry. Overall, the results did not match our hypothesis, but they still provide insight into how Gamergate might have influenced the way people in the gaming community speak about diversity in their games.
