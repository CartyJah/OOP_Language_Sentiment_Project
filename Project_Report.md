    Our group analyzed the effects of an online harassment campaign known as "Gamergate" on language use by fans throughout the gaming industry. Specifically, did Gamergate cause people in the gaming community to adopt more negative language? Gamergate, a movement that took place from 2013-2014, was a campaign focused on harassing women and minorities in the gaming community. In order to analyze the effects of Gamergate, we looked at social media posts for two games that were released before and after Gamergate. The games that were released before Gamergate were Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 and Dragon Age: Inquisition, and the games released after Gamergate were Baldurs Gate 3 and Grand Theft Auto 6. Black Ops 2 and GTA 6 are both games with very toxic communities, while Dragon Age and Baldurs Gate 3 have less controversial communities with more female and LGBTQ representation. We did this on purpose to analyze the effects of Gamergate on different spheres of the gaming community. 
    Our data collection methods consisted of manually scraping tweets from the official announcement post for each game. While we initially wished to scrape large amounts of data, the python package we had planned on using was not supported on the version of python using in JupyterHub. For each post except for GTA 6, each comment was collected to ensure that there was no bias in data collection. For GTA 6, the first 200 tweets were chosen all at once to ensure that there was no bias in data collection. After collecting the tweets, the language sentiment of each tweet was analyzed using the VADER sentiment python package. VADER, which stands for Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner, is a tool used to analyze language sentiment in social media. VADER is what told us whether or not each tweet was positive or negative. In order to use VADER, we used an additional package called the Natural Language Resource Toolkit. This was necessary for classifying the text in the tweets and providing a lexicon for VADER to use.
    After all of the data was collected and processed through VADER, we were able to create plots and compare data between the games before and after Gamergate. Our initial beliefs were that the games released before Gamergate, Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 and
