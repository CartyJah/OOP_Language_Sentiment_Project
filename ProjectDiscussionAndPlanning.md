Method for communication: Discord (We've already friend one another and made the groupchat.)

Meeting times: We have decided that we will have a meeting day once a week around Wednesday. The meetings will be throughout the entire day where we will text and update one another. It's impossible for someone to miss a meeting because it will be ongoing throughout all of Wednesday.

Strategies to ensure contribution: We will be required to update one another on progress on individual work, and notify one another about events that might interfere.

Overall Goals: Our project will have a tangible and hopefully unprecedented insight into the sentiment of language online.

Project Roles:
Jahlique Carty - Reminderer
John Lupokovich - Emotion Support
Geoffrey Giannetti - Code Tester
Zackary Willoughby - Slide Developer

Short-Term goals:
1. Obtain dataset and find packages during first meeting, as well as creating an outline.
2. During the second and third meetings, we will work on building our models.
3. For every meeting after that, we will continue working on models and start making model visualizations.

First Meeting: Wednesday November 5th
