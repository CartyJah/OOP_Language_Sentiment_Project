 you guys just made me so happy <3
cannot wait to play it on PS4!
good to know! I hope the extra cash from the timed exclusive helps :) looking forward to playing in May!
I'm not understanding why people are upset here... May is only another month away! Get excited! At least we ARE getting it.
"For once since release, you guys gave us PC gamers loving. We are grateful."
already completed it lol
what the hell? This is ridiculous!!
check this!
"just in time for Witcher 3! Wait, that's bad."
What a fucking joke. You guys just lost a *long* time customer.
wow....may? Timed exclusives are so dumb. This is not making me wanna buy an xbox one lmao.
... What. May?! Seriously?! Good god.
In May on #PS4 it's a SHAME!!!!
"will probably save my 15$, sorry to say.  Even being a huge DA supporter.  Will wait and see if it happens with the next game."
" and waiting for it to May, with spoilers posted everywhere, even here...  The excitement has been sucked out of me for this."
"after all the excitement for DA:I on the ps4 and hours of playing, then a story dlc finally... Only it was exclusive to xbone--"
out of curiosity why such a long delay?

"I play on pc, but timed exclusives are lame. Hope the money is worth losing your fan base."
"keep it.  Way to let EA bring you down bioware.  If you guys decide to pull this with ME a heads up would be nice,i wont waste $"
when in May will it available for the PS4 as really want to play it
May? We have to dodge spoilers until May? ):
Not surprising consider xbox does the same with cod dlc >_>
Nice! It'll be like a birthday gift from Bioware :)
This disappoints and saddens me very much as a dedicated fan:/ Unfortunately a fan who prefers PS. But yay for getting a date! :D
"good thing the witcher 3 isn't coming out in May or you might have some pretty serious loss of sales on your hands. 
Oh wait..."
"Good Job, EA fucked up Big Time. DLC Comes last on the Console where the game sold most, which idiot decided that."
[disgusted noise] MAY??? :'(
may? What? When it's ready now? All DLC no matter what it is should be available at the same time!
May WTF ur joking right i mean seriously
"Way to be assholes, guys. Like we needed another reason to hate Microshaft & EA"
"So all other platforms include Xbox 360, right? Oh god I hope I'm right."
"Yeah, no thanks."

to far away ;.;
"Ignore the whiners, each console gets plenty of timed exclusives. Won't stop me from getting it day 1 it's available for the 360"
what the heck? Why does Sony have to wait two months for!? The anticipation is killing me.

" Just finished it on PC, it's worth the wait. :)  I'll probably be buried in Witcher 3 in May though.  Sorry PS4."
May??? What a joke. Such a bad business practice.
"May? That's too long, I want it now!"
honestly as a playstation user i regret spending $108 dollars at your store only to get this kind of treatment :(
pc master race is masterful
MAY?
"Wow. That sucks for PS4. Sorry, guys. Not cool, EA. Not cool."
Is this what it feels like to be isolated from the cool kids?
hoping this is an early April fools??
that's a long time to try and dodge spoilers. Lol ps player are not the favored child??
fantastic..... That was sarcasm. I was making a sarcastic comment.
"Hey everyone, let's see how long it takes to bring the next DLC to consoles other than Xbox One."
that's kind of a massive letdown. Really hope this won't be the standard for 360 users with future dlc.
May?!  Not worth it.
May!? That's quite a deal you must have with Microsoft…
How are we PS4 players expected to enjoy your games with the same enjoyment after getting screwed with this dlc timing?
In MAY? Really? I feel bad for my friends on Playstation. :(
"Yes, make half of your market wait 2 months. Brilliant business decision. /sarcasm"
So very heart broken. I've been a fan since the beginning and you have let me down BIG TIME! ??WHY???
extremely disappointing that ps4 players are getting shafted
Can't imagine how long Black Emporium will take.
:D
Seriously...? :( I'm in denial until April 2nd.
so we got to wait until May? Enjoy the MS $$ disappointing to see this practise used.
"May till 360 as well? Bah, @Microsoft REALLY wants me to spend my fixed income on a new system. i haven't mine RROD'd yet. ;)"
I will eagerly await whilst playing the masterpiece that is #Bloodborne
wow.. That is a lot longer than I was expecting to wait
"May? Really? Well thanks for that, I just started replaying @masseffect anyhow."
i loved #DAI but fuck you guys. This is unacceptable!
Thank you
$25 Aud is a rip off for a dlc if it was a ful xpansion yeah maybe but not just a dlc
do you really want to make me cry-y-y
do you really want to hurt me
"CONFIRMED: Dragon Age: Inquisition – Jaws of Hakkon comes to all other platforms in May!"" It is cruel"
kind of lame. restricting the game is one thing but the dlc is another. is it really worth the money?
a whole month to wait! Oh well more destiny for me.
Oh..... my.... fucking..... god..............
CONFIRMED: Dragon Age: Inquisition – Jaws of Hakkon comes to all other platforms in May! MAY?!?! Wtf!
so long :(
It really is pretty ridiculous. I just hope all the dlcs won't have this timed exclusive BS
ya'll blow... Mid April made more sense
I love Dragon Age but the longer you leave it the less I care
That’s pretty bad. Was hoping for mid April at the latest. Disappointed in Bioware and EA for this.
so you left behind the people that have buy more your game (ps4) forget it...thank you..........bye
I'll be too busy playing #heavensward to care at that point. Hope the ms money was worth it.
"lol fuck off. I'm not waiting a whole month. Here's an idea,  how's about you and Microsoft go fuck yourselves? :D"

"I don't get it, DAI sold twice on PS4, but the DLC comes first for XO and it will take almost two months to release it for PS4."
Huge disappointment.  I was back on board with Bioware for DA:I but timed releases are a dealbreaker.  is only about $$$
No thanks. You blew your chance at further business from us.
sigh
Handsome Collection will keep me busy til then :P
MAY!!! We'll all be dead by then!
whee! Hakkon comes out for PS4 SIX WEEKS after it already released. Awesome job making all fans happy.
You guys chose the wrong console. Haha but who cares. I bought this game and I still haven't played it. Lmao
Finally a date ! I haste to play it. ^^
well boo-frigging-hoo
you are fucking kidding me...BIGGEST BULLSHIT EVER
 I will not buy this at full price.
ridiculous. When it goes on sale I'll pick it up. This is so stupid.
"Even though its only a month delay for us #PS4 players its still ridiculous, I hope this is the only timed exclusive dlc for #DAI"
Argh! Damn @EA RT @dragonage CONFIRMED: Dragon Age: Inquisition – Jaws of Hakkon comes to all other platforms in May!
Hello! Will it be at the beginning of May or at the end of the month? :p Thanks! :)
but don't really care. Gave me enough time to tweak my elven quizzy gameplay
I will have to agree with a few other folks. Witcher 3 is coming out :( that will certainly preoccupy my time
That's good news... But a strange business model... Why not get PS4 owner's money from day 1?
CONFIRMED: Dragon Age: Inquisition – Jaws of Hakkon comes to all other platforms in May! In what universe is this GOOD news?
"same time as the witcher? Meh, wont buy it then"
Well fuck this and all that MS $$$ you got to piss off Sony fans. Don't fucking do this again! FUCKERS!
"That and your negativity makes 
@dragonage
 feel unsafe. Thank Microsoft for funding this DLC. Otherwise it doesn't happen."
"Stop being so negative at 
@dragonage
 . As a small indy publisher they can only do this type of DLC with 3rd party support."
the game is completely shit beyond belief worst in the series. Bring on @witchergame 3!
Finally!
to bad it does not release on ps4 in May i will play witcher 3
